 * marketing/ : The "Future-Back" Press Release and messaging pillars.
 * governance/ : The FAQ (Financial Risks, Competitor Analysis, and "Hard Questions").
📋 Methodology: The "Working Backwards" Approach
This project followed a four-stage strategic process:
1. The Vision (The PR/FAQ)
We began at the end: a Press Release dated two years in the future. By defining what "massive success" looks like (10% market share), we identified the core value proposition: Bridging the gap between US agility and Japanese corporate consensus.
2. The Cultural Logic (Strategic Tenets)
To avoid the "Aggressive Expansion" trap, we established four guiding principles:
 * Polished over Pivot: Quality as credibility.
 * Consensus over Command: Supporting the Ringi (bottom-up approval) process.
 * Support as a Product: High-touch, local technical service.
 * Local Roots: Empowering Tokyo-based leadership.
3. The Stress Test (The Cynical CFO Review)
We simulated a board-level confrontation to identify vulnerabilities:
 * Financial Risk: Managing high CAC and long Japanese sales cycles.
 * Opportunity Cost: Defending the choice of Japan over lower-friction markets (e.g., UK).
 * Execution: Mitigating the "SoftBank/Incumbent" threat.
4. The Narrative (The 6-Page Memo)
The final output is a dense, data-driven Executive Memo summarizing the "Why," "How," and "What" of the investment, justifying a $2M initial capital allocation.
